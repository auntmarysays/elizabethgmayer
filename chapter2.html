                    <h3>Chapter 2: Space Oddity</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Eustis Anne Avery wasn’t a normal girl, and she liked it like that. At the age of six, after an extensive evaluation of her psychological and physical capabilities and an in depth examination of her family’s psychological and physical history, she had been chosen to be among the astronauts aboard the Rhea Silvia, the first manned mission to Mars. She had trained for the exhibition her entire childhood. She had never attended a normal school or interacted with normal children. Along with one other girl and boy, she had received private instruction from highly educated tutors and followed a rigorous physical training regime designed to prepare her for the intense journey and succeeding inhabitation of the Earth’s ruddy neighbor.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">When she was fifteen, she had run away from her home in Houston, Texas. She had ridden trains and slept with older men and tried drugs and eaten out of dumpsters, and now—forever a fugitive, a derelict, a waste of many, many, many United States government dollars—she was smoking a cigarette into her plump, strong lungs and talking to some half-dumb boy and feeling just a little bit heart-broken about her skinny ex (?)(yes, definitely ex!) boyfriend with the thick cock and gentle fingers who (oh god!) could make her come like an avalanche, but unfortunately couldn’t appreciate the magnitude of her greatness and was, as a consequence, being quickly and methodically banished into the deep nether regions of her memory—deep, deep down, where the image of his face would shrivel with that of her mother’s reproving frown—deep, deep down, where he couldn’t hurt her anymore.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Eustis had learned a lot of things in the three years she’d been on the run. She knew now that she didn’t like to sleep with men who tried to pay her after the fact. She knew she liked punk rock and post rock and space rock—even if it was bad, just as long as it wasn’t boring. She knew that drugs were ok, sometimes, but not if she couldn’t remember what happened while she was on them, and, that they weren’t really necessary, because she knew how to have fun, was good at it, without drugs—something which wasn’t true for everyone. She also knew that she liked weirdos. And it was immediately apparent that Ziggy Stardust Learner was a weirdo.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Where do you come from, Ziggy?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">He looked up, as if he had come from outer space. “Just here,” he said, with a sort of fraught resolution, as if he meant to say, I don’t know where I come from. His eyes clouded over, and he looked sad.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“And, do you like it here?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Ziggy looked puzzled, as if he’d never really thought about it, although he had a thousand times. “No, not really. I suppose I’ll leave someday.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“I’m leaving tomorrow,” Eustis said. “I play the violin.” She motioned toward the black case on her back. “Richard from the Horrible Nerds asked me to leave with them. Open their shows. They’re going cross country. An open-ended tour as long as their cash lasts.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“They’re good,” Ziggy said, thinking of Jelly’s round butt and the way she closed her eyes when her fingers plucked the strings of her bass.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“I guess so. Yeah, they are. Good in that raw, real way. Good because they don’t ask for anything, you know? Don’t expect anything from their audience.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Ziggy nodded. He had no response for her, didn’t know what to make of her. Wondered if Jelly was still inside. Wondered if his mother had left. Wondered why, on earth, this strange girl paid him any attention.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Do you play? Anything?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Hmm?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“An instrument? Do you play music? An instrument?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Ziggy shook his head. “The piano, a bit.” He had played since he was four and one of his mother’s boyfriends had bought him a keyboard. “I guess I can play the piano.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Well, let’s do it, then. I have my violin. You can play Andy’s synth. Let’s do it. Tonight. Doesn’t matter if we aren’t any good. And I am—good. Really good. It’ll be brilliant.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Ziggy looked at her bulging blue eyes and his hands shook as he finished his cigarette. The memory of his last ever piano recital at the age of fourteen flashed through his mind—his trembling fingers, the metallic taste in his mouth, his mother sitting on the leather sofa in the yellow-lit living room of his piano teacher with her legs crossed, sitting just a little too close to the unknown father beside her. He had played Moonlight Sonata, too loud and too fast, so that by the time his teacher turned the sheet music to the third page, the pads of his fingers throbbed and the crescendo of broken chords reached a deafening volume. He stood up immediately after finishing, so quickly that the backs of his thighs knocked over the piano bench, and walked, head down, face burning, back to the den to drink punch and eat cookies with the other students. He never saw the enormous grin spread across his mother’s face. He couldn’t hear her heartbroken applause.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Now, here in the concrete backyard of the dirty row house on 6th Street, this strange girl was asking him to perform again, perform before a crowd of strangers infinitely cooler and more intimidating, perform with zero preparation, perform with her in front of Jelly, and he had the odd, overwhelming feeling that he could not refuse her.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">She flicked the cherry from her cigarette and lobbed the butt into a flower pot. “Come on,” she said.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The basement steps shook with the quick beat of a kick drum. The skinny boy was slumped down into a threadbare couch in the back of the room. Ziggy’s mother stood inches from the band, clutching the neck of a champagne bottle. The crowd was moving in disjointed unison to the digging bassline.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Ziggy followed Eustis to the middle. He couldn’t see Jelly anywhere. She couldn’t have left. The Horrible Nerds were still there. Their singer, Richard, was leaning against the old rusted cylinder of a hot water heater. Eustis brushed her cheek close to the singer’s neck and shouted something into his ear. He glanced toward Ziggy and nodded at Eustis.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Eustis stepped back and put her face so close to Ziggy that he thought he could feel her lips on his earlobe. “We’re on. Next. This is the last band. Get ready. They’re almost through.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">A tambourine shook. The symbol trembled. Ziggy felt like he was about to vomit. The music stopped.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Come on,” Eustis said, wriggling the violin case off her back and moving toward the front of the room. The band was unplugging their instruments, winding up cords.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Ziggy followed Eustis and brushed past his mother.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Ziggy?” she said loudly, her voice thick with champagne. Ziggy glanced at her briefly, shrugged, and followed Eustis.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Eustis was talking to the keyboard player. She nodded toward Ziggy. Ziggy stepped toward them.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“It’s cool, Ziggy,” Eustis said, pulling her violin and bow from the case. “Are you ready?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Ziggy wasn’t ready. His hands felt like streams of lava dissolving from the ends of his wrists. The keyboard player stepped back, gesturing for Ziggy to take his place. It wasn’t real. His hands were gone. His mother was drunk. It was time to go home. The crowd was clomping up the staircase, shouting to each other over the ringing in their ears.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Eustis leaned over the keyboard toward Ziggy. “Just try to follow me, ok?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Eustis stepped close to the microphone and rested her violin against her shoulder. She laid her chin in the chinrest and jutted out her elbow, drawing the bow against the strings of her violin.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The sound was sharp and sudden and utterly arresting. The hairs on Ziggy’s arms stood up, tears pricked his eyes, and the vibration of the violin flooded his body. The room was immediately still. It was the kind of music that cracked open all of your bones and made your insides spill out into the universe. It was the kind of music that transported your whole self to that other plane, to that unearthly, euphoric place where time did not exist. It was the kind of music that destroyed you, dissolved completely any consciousness of self, until you weren’t you at all—because you were everything.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Eustis’s bow slid against the strings of the violin. The way her head bent into the instrument, it was as if it were part of her—a strange, magical appendage flowing out from her neck with the power to capture souls. She turned toward Ziggy and nodded.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">She wanted him to play. He had no breath. His head was lost inside of the sound of the violin. He looked at the keyboard, let his fingers hover over the keys, and listened for the progression of the chords. He knew the song, though he’d never played it before. <em>C, E, F. F minor, C, E, F.</em></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Ziggy’s fingers pressed the keys, softly at first, a timid accompaniment, then with increasing confidence and complexity. The synthesized notes formed a cloud of noise beneath the piercing bravado of the violin. It sounded good, Ziggy thought. It sounded really good. He was playing, and it sounded really good.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The bow glided across the strings of the violin for one final, low sigh, then dropped to the side of Eustis’s body. Ziggy let the synthesizer moan as Eustis straightened her head and lowered the violin from her shoulder, then he released his fingers from the keys.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Assorted hoots and whistles sprang up from the crowd. Somebody shouted, “Fuck, yeah!” Ziggy’s mother tripped over a snarl of chords, leaned over the keyboard, and kissed him on the cheek.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“My beautiful boy,” she said. Her eyes were teary. She was drunk.</p>
