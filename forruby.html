                    <h3>For Ruby</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Always eat breakfast—protein, fiber, and not too much sugar.<sup>1</sup>  Take care of your teeth.  Brush and floss every day.<sup>2</sup>  Don’t smoke!  I know cigarettes seem alluring when you’re young, but in reality they are disgusting and bad for your health.<sup>3</sup>  Given your family history, I would avoid drugs and alcohol, too.<sup>4</sup>  If you’re not sure what you want to do, it’s OK to take some time off between high school and college.  Very few people are set in their desired career by the age of twenty-three, and there’s no need to be.<sup>5</sup>  Get at least eight hours of sleep per night.<sup>6</sup>  If you can’t sleep, just try to stop thinking.<sup>7</sup>  And try not to worry.  Worrying is wasted time.  It serves no purpose.<sup>8</sup>  Don’t have sex with strangers.<sup>9</sup>  Meditate for at least ten minutes every day.  Tell the truth.  Pity the liar, but don’t believe him.<sup>10</sup>  Don’t fall in love with a liar!  Speak kindly.  Make your words ameliorate pain, not cause it.<sup>11</sup>  If the world starts compressing, and you find yourself counting your heartbeats and holding your breath, look up.  Remember the universe is infinite, and you are part of it.  And try, try, try not to be afraid.</p>
                    <br>
                    <em><p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>1</sup><small>Tofu scramble with veggies is an excellent option.  If you choose to eat meat, don’t forget the pain that was endured for your meal.  Also, red meat is carcinogenic, so you should probably just avoid it all together.</small></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>2</sup><small>Your great-grandmother on your father’s side had to have all of her teeth extracted when she arrived in the United States from Ireland.  She had full dentures before she was twenty-five.  Your Nana has partial dentures as well.  Her teeth were knocked out by an angry boyfriend.</small></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>3</sup><small>If you have to smoke, try to quit before you’re twenty-five—smoking just gets grosser the older you get.</small></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>4</sup><small>You are five times more likely to become an addict because addiction runs in your family—it’s a can of worms better left unopened.  It’s also bad for your teeth.  See footnote 2, re: Nana.</small></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>5</sup><small>I think I learned a great deal more by completing college in a circuitous manner.  But do try to find your pigeon hole eventually.  Even if you decide to do something completely different, it’s nice to know your niche.</small></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>6</sup><small>One day, if you have children, you’ll realize how vastly underappreciated sleep is.  Hopefully I will be there to hold the baby, so you can take a nap.</small></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>7</sup><small>Auntie Carter once said, “I don’t know why people can’t sleep.  I just get in bed and relax my eyes and I’m asleep.”  Try it.  Relax your eyes.  It works.</small></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>8</sup><small>If you’re worried that people are talking about you, they’re probably not.  They’re worried about themselves, not you. And if they are talking about you, they’re probably saying good things. But they’re probably not talking about you—you’re just being paranoid. And, please, don’t worry about what I think. You are the sun and moon to me; nothing you could do would make me feel otherwise. I trust you completely.</small></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>9</sup><small>One night stands are worthless, rarely gratifying in any way, and dangerous.  It makes me shudder to think how careless I was with my body when I was younger.  Not that careless, but careless enough.</small></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>10</sup><small>And don’t let one liar sully your faith in the rest of humanity.  Most people are not trying to deceive you.</small></p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom"><sup>11</sup><small>If you speak ill of people behind their backs, the person with whom you are speaking will probably assume you speak badly about them as well.  Gossip ruins trust and dilutes friendships. </small></p></em>
