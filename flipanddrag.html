                    <h3>Flip and Drag</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“I can’t go into that place dressed like this.” Jerome Walker shakes his shoulders inside the loose, green Henley. The strips of tape vertically adhering the wire to his torso pull at the sparse strands of chest hair it’s taken him so long to cultivate. “They’re gonna know I’m a fucking narc the second I walk in.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The detective snorts. “What? You afraid of a bunch a queers?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Fuck yeah, I’m afraid. A hundred weight-lifting buff fucking gays in razor-sharp stilettos? You think I want to be on the losing end of that bet? Fuck no.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The detective reaches inside Jerome’s collar and adjusts the button that looks like a button. “Well, champ, unless you’ve got a tiny camera sewn into one of those fancy cowboy shirts, I guess you’re out of luck. Pretty sure the ladies’ blouse we got ain’t gonna fit you.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The younger cop at the table swivels his chair to face Jerome. “Besides, you got nothing to worry about—one look at those pearly whites and every faggot in the place is gonna be busting out of their panties. Just relax. And remember, this is your last buy. After tonight, you’re home free. Debt paid. Like you never fucking did a thing.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Jerome flexes his fingers. His palms are clammy. He wishes he had never fucking done a thing. One fucking ounce of weed to that motherfucking rat Drew—a favor, he hadn’t made a single dime—and the cops had him by the balls. Drew, that fucking rat, forcing Jerome to be a fucking rat… But he had no choice. He had to flip. If Maureen found out, Jesus, she’d leave him for sure this time. She’d leave, and she’d take Sophia, and his life would be fucked.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Alright, sport, let’s get you in the van.” The detective opens the door and they exit the white room into the lobby. Outside beneath a flickering street lamp, the younger cop slides open the door of a beat-up blue van that bears the chipped logo of a carpet cleaning service.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">He winks at Jerome. “After you.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Max Whack tosses his apron into the laundry bag behind the counter for the last time. Jutting out his right hip, he shoots an imaginary gun and winks at Al the bartender. He ducks his head into the dank stairwell that leads down to the office and punches his timecard. He blows a kiss at Melody as she stretches her plastic grin to greet a table of five, salutes George as he rests a rack of steaming glasses against the bar, bows deeply with the undulant flourish of a concert pianist, pirouettes one hundred and eighty degrees, and struts through the double doors of Tarleton Oak Restaurant for the last time. Tarleton Oak has just lost the finest busboy to ever clear a table.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Main Street sparkles tonight, its haloed streetlamps buzzing pleasantly, the flecks of glass in the cement shimmering like bubbles in a champagne flute. Max’s hips sway evenly left to right as each of his steps falls on the imaginary straight line before him with the practiced precision of a catwalk-walker.  Passing the glowing marquis of the old Hancock Theater, he imagines himself gliding through the streets of Manhattan, hovering over the sidewalk like a bedazzled angel, stunning the masses with his luminous presence. His lips part and teeth gleam as he passes the huddled vagrants and loitering bike cops. The night is warm and large, and, as he opens his mouth wider to take it all in, Max can’t help but laugh.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">At midnight, he will be eighteen. Jonathan has promised him a position at the club. By tomorrow, he’ll be a genuine cocktail waitress. No more smelling like week-old fryer oil. No more hauling plastic tubs of half-chewed food. No more feigning deafness at the warbled jeers of the crack-head line cook. And, of course, there’s the money. The girls who serve at Banana Blues make more in one night than a busboy makes in a week. He’ll have the back rent paid in a month. They won’t have to leave the apartment. He’ll cook Momma steak instead of spaghetti. He’ll buy her a bed that doesn’t hurt her back. Maybe she’ll get stronger. Maybe she’ll get well.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Momma is asleep in her easy chair when Max enters the dim apartment. Pat Sajak reels hazily on the tired television set in the corner. Wrapped in a frayed rayon scarf, Momma’s head hangs heavily over her neck. The knobs of her spine protrude through the back of her cotton nightgown and her veins snake visibly beneath her skin as if she were some inert embryonic creature, vulnerable and exposed. Max steps toward her. Tilting her head against the back of the chair, he kisses the yellowing skin of her brow, thin as paper, and whispers, “Don’t worry, Momma.</p><p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Everything will be alright.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The back of the van where Jerome sits is windowless. The seats have been removed to make room for surveillance equipment. Vibrations from the cold metal floor tremble up his back. In the front seat the cops speak in hushed voices, and through the crackling speakers Jerome can hear Hank Williams commiserating with the lonesome whippoorwill. He leans his head back and closes his eyes and thinks, Jesus Christ, Jerome, you are a fucking idiot.</p> 
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Sophia will be a year old next month. Maureen has probably already put her to bed. She’s probably already sleeping with her tiny, fat fingers curled up into fists and her sweet, fat lips exhaling softly. She looks perfect when she sleeps, more beautiful than anything Jerome has ever seen. If he lost her, he would die, he’s sure of it.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Maureen’s voice echoes in his head, a variation on the same argument they’ve had a thousand times since the day she found out she was pregnant: “If you really loved her, you’d quit all this stupid bullshit. I’m tired of us being last on your list. I can’t believe you’d rather drive across town to bring one of your stupid friends a bag of weed than be here to kiss your daughter goodnight. I hope you realize that while you’re out there helping your so-called friends, you’re shitting on the people that really matter—your family. And, Jerome, I’m fucking sick of it.”
                    He’d told her she was crazy, maybe even called her a bitch, but deep down, Jerome knew she was right. He couldn’t say no. He couldn’t refuse to help a friend. They needed him and he needed them, even if it meant sleeping on the couch with the dog instead of in the warm queen-sized bed with Maureen.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">But all that’s over now. From now on Sophia and Maureen will be his only priority. He won’t be a deadbeat like his own father. He’ll stop disappearing. He won’t disappear. He’ll come straight home from work. He’ll eat dinner with them every night. He’ll wake up early with Sophia so that Maureen can sleep late. Then she won’t be so tired. Then she’ll be happy. Then they’ll have sex every day like they did when they were first together.</p><p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">They’ll get married! They’ll make Sophia a baby brother! They’ll be the next goddamn fucking Cleavers with clean clothes and perfect teeth and life lessons and hot meatloaf, and none of them will ever be sad or bored or lonely again.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Jerome starts as the door of the van rushes open, squealing against its rusted track. The spit in his mouth has evaporated completely. His armpits are sweating. He wonders if the perspiration could fry the wires zigzagging across his skin. A sick, panicky feeling churns inside his stomach.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The older cop is eyeing him carefully. “You alright, son?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Jerome swallows thickly and nods.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“This is gonna be just like all the other times. We’ll be right here in the van, just around the corner. If things start getting hot, all you gotta do is say ‘I need a drink’ and we’ll be at your back in less than a minute. Come on now.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">He extends a wide, hard-looking hand towards Jerome. Jerome takes it and heaves himself out of the van into the dark alley. He’s pretty sure that it takes less than a minute to fire a gun. The cop claps him firmly on the shoulder, and he stumbles toward the streetlamp at the end of the alley trying to replace the pounding in his head with images of his sleeping daughter.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Max stands naked before the full-length mirror which hangs from the back of his bedroom door and gently tucks his genitals up between his legs. He shimmies into a pair of black nylon bikinis and yanks the waistband upward, hard. His masculinity carefully folded backward inside himself, he pats his smooth pelvis and throws himself a conspiratorial wink in the mirror. He fastens a blue lace bustier around his chest—“Oooh la la!”—and removes two lumps of silicone resembling raw chicken cutlets from the top drawer of his dresser, placing them in the vacant cups of the bustier.  He jostles his shoulders, thrilled yet aware of the perils of arousal, and stretches a leopard-print spandex mini-dress over his head, adjusting the low, round neckline so that just enough blue lace peeks from beneath. Taking his seat at the vanity beside the dresser, he waves his palms over tubes of sparkling pink and gold dust, impossibly long lashes of every color, vials of fluorescent gloss, small stacks of powders, creams! creams! creams!—a cosmetics collection that any queen would be proud of, but that he, poor-little-old Max, has amassed. When his face is complete, his eyes are shaded by blue and gold lashes that curl backward into his dramatically angled, kohl-etched eyebrows. His cheekbones are high and gilded, his lips slick and neon tangerine. He kisses the air and pulls on a fluffy, gold-flecked afro that fits tightly over his shaved head. He rolls a pair of fishnets up his legs and steps into a pair of blue velvet stilettos. In the mirror, he licks his forefinger and touches it to his feline print derrière. Sizzle. The transformation is complete. 
                    Max reaches beneath the skirt of her bed and retrieves a small, metal lockbox. She spins the numbers of the lock to 1-1-2-0 and pops open the latch. Inside are twelve tiny plastic bags of MDMA, the last of her quota for Richie, the end of her illicit labor. By tomorrow, she won’t need the extra income. She’ll sell them all tonight and be done. She places the bags in a small satin pouch and tucks them beneath her left chicken cutlet. Her heart beats a little faster.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Sandra Double D is perched voluptuously at the door of Banana Blues as Max walks up. She hops from her stool and air kisses both of Max’s cheeks—“Mwah! Mwah!”—before ushering her through the door.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Maxine, my dream, how lovely to see you!” Her voice is swallowed quickly by the heavy bass that thuds rhythmically inside the club.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The mirror ball spins, casting swirling trapezoids of light against the walls and ceiling. Max winds her way through the hot crowd of feathers and wings and weaves—“Oooh, girl, look at that dress! Grrrr!” “Maxine, kitty cat! You are looking fierce!” “Oh, my sweet little Maxy, I hear you turn eighteen tonight!” She catches the eye of José, the bartender with the broad shoulders and brown eyes, and smiles. He winks at her and juggles a bottle of tequila behind his back and over his shoulder.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">From a semi-circle booth near the stage, Richie stands. He brushes the front of his purple three-piece suit and motions for Max to approach. Gilda Godiva has taken the stage, and as the thumping stereo fades, she begins a slow falsetto rendition of Petula Clark’s “Downtown,” quickly softening the club’s roar. Richie takes Max’s hand and kisses her knuckles. The club darkens and a spotlight trails Godiva’s sequined form to the center of the stage then down onto the floor as she weaves through the crowd. Richie pulls Max into his booth, already full with two hyperbolically muscled men and one conspicuously soft female. He raises his eyebrows and asks in low, velvety voice, “Do I really have to lose my best girl tonight?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Max lowers her heavy lashes. “Oh, Richie, you been good to me, I know that. But you know my momma’s sick. If I got picked up with this shit, what would happen to her? I’m all she’s got.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">He stares at her for what seems like a very long time. She can feel his eyes on her skin like lasers, but she continues to look down. A trickle of sweat rolls down her jaw. The blond in the booth snaps her fingers at a waitress walking by and holds up her empty drink, jangling the ice cubes against the side of the glass.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Richie laughs. “Alright, Maxine. Don’t worry, I’m gonna let you go.” Max looks up to meet his gaze. “But if you ever want back in, all you gotta do is ask. You really are the best, you know. Never given me a single reason not to trust you, and that’s saying a lot. Alright, get goin’—I know you still got some dope in those tits.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Max flashes Richie a grin and slides out of the booth with her back arched. Godiva has climbed back onto the stage. She struts quickly from one end to the other as the tempo of “Last Dance” builds. The neon lights begin to spin and the crowd erupts into a gyrating mass of skin and glitter. Max steals an ice cube from someone’s abandoned glass and bobs through the dance floor toward the bathrooms. Beside the dark hallway that leads to the ladies’ room is a reproduction of a red British phone booth that was abandoned by the owners of the pub-style restaurant that once occupied the space. Max kicks her right stiletto against the booth and leans back, balancing on one foot like a flamingo.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">It takes a minute for Max to recognize him. He’s wearing some sort of awful, sloppy shirt and his hair is a sweaty, matted mess, but it’s definitely him—Jerome, her low-life next door neighbor, stumbling through the crowd like a pig in a hen house, saucer-eyed like he’s just walked in on his parents having sex, tripping across the floor in those ugly white sneakers, heading for her booth. What does he want? And what in God’s name is he wearing? He may be a jerk, but he’s not unattractive, most of the time. Max has never seen him look this bad. She’s never seen him at the club, either, but she’s not exactly surprised he’s here—he follows the party.</p> 
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Jerome walks straight up to Max. “Hey,” he says gruffly, “I’m looking for that girl Molly.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Max scans Jerome from foot to head and rolls her eyes. What a loser. She’s heard the arguments through the bedroom walls. He treats Maureen like shit, doesn’t help with the baby at all, spends all their money on weed. He’s a deadbeat, just like Max’s father. Maureen would be better off without him.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Tenths for fifteen or grams for one-twenty,” Max says with disinterest.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“I’ll take a gram,” Jerome says quickly, looking back toward the dance floor.</p><p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Max peers at him, lips pursed, and drops her other foot to the floor. She shakes her head, opens the door of the phone booth, and pulls Jerome inside. “Tell you what, motherfucker, it’s your lucky day.” She reaches inside the bustier and pulls out the satin pouch. “How’d you like two tenths on the house? It’s only an hour till my birthday, and I’m ready to get the fuck out of this phone booth.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Jerome pulls a fold of bills from his jeans and counts out six twenties. Max plucks the cash from his fingers and presses the pouch into his chest.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The woman at the door of the club has biceps the size of Jerome’s waist and boobs the size of his head. Jerome tries to breathe normally as she glances back and forth from his I.D. to his face. Finally, she hands it back and motions for him to enter.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Fan of Godiva?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Huh?”</p> 
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Gilda Godiva? Performing tonight?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Oh, yeah, of course.” Jerome musters a smile. “She’s the best, right?”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The woman smiles coyly. “She is the best. Have fun, darling.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The air inside the club is thick and humid and smells like a high school locker room. Jerome begins to sweat immediately. The bartender is pouring Blue Curaçao into what looks like a fish bowl and topping it with four maraschino cherries pierced by the stem of a miniature pink umbrella. God, what Jerome wouldn’t give for one those right now. He’s only been to the club twice before, late-night and shit-canned, before Sophia was born, back when all Maureen wanted to do was dance. She’s beautiful when she dances. He should take her dancing, soon.</p> 
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">According to another confidential informant, the person he’s supposed to find posts up by the phone booth in the back of the club. He has to cross the dance floor. The singer in the gold sequined evening gown kicking her way across the stage must be Gilda Godiva. She really is good. The crowd is rollicking, euphoric. This actually might be fun under different circumstances. Jerome takes a deep breath and makes his way onto the floor. Immediately, he is bombarded by bodies. He walks head first into a huge blue bouffant and sputters for a moment before reorienting himself.</p> 
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Everyone is staring at him. A girl just pointed directly at him and whispered something to her friend. They know. They all know. They can tell by his clothes, his nervousness, his total lack of rhythm. He needs to get out of here. He should just leave now. The crowd is swallowing him alive. He can’t breathe. Jesus Christ, it’s fucking hot as shit. His armpits are drenched. He’s going to pass out. Ugh, he’s going to puke.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">No, there it is! He can see the booth. He’s almost there. It won’t be long until he’s a free man, and once he is, he’s never going to cross Uncle Sam again. This is the start of a new life: Jerome Walker, stand-up citizen.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">The girl by the phone booth is young. Even under the layers of make-up and that ridiculous wig, Jerome can tell. She has skin like a baby. She looks like a little girl dressed up. He gets close enough to smell her perfume and clears his throat.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Hey, I’m looking for that girl Molly.”</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Oh man, she is tough. She is a tough little girl. She barely acknowledges his presence then scans him up and down, squinting, as if he were covered in shit. So much for customer service. She grips his arm with surprisingly strong fingers and pulls him inside the booth. It smells like sweat and God knows what else. Multicolored Sharpie graffiti covers the inside surfaces of the windows. The darkness is cut intermittently by the spinning strobe light that makes the gold flecks in the girl’s afro twinkle. Jerome tries to understand what she’s saying, but he feels like his ears are stuffed with cotton.</p> 
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">What is she talking about? Fuck. The money. He fumbles for the roll of twenties in his pocket and tries to make his fingers hold still as he counts out six. Their faces are less than a foot apart. He holds up the money and she grabs it quickly, thrusting a shiny bag against his chest. The wires press into his skin. He breathes in sharply.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">“Enjoy,” Max sings and pushes past him out of the booth. She takes a deep breath from the bottom of her abdomen and spins onto the dance floor. She’s free. She’s legitimate. She’ll never have to step foot inside that phone booth again—that is, of course, unless she wants to. Maybe José will slip her a cocktail for her birthday. A Cosmo in a coffee mug? She’ll give Richie his money first. Take care of business then celebrate.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">For a moment, as she dance-walks towards Richie’s table, she hesitates. Poor Maureen. She deserves better. She’s a good person, genuinely kind and considerate. And that sweet little baby… Just yesterday, through her bedroom wall, Max heard Jerome promise he was going straight for good. No more drugs, no more shady dealings, just total devotion. What a liar. What a dirty little liar he is.</p> 
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Max’s stomach flip-flops. It’s not right. Something isn’t right. She falters, grabbing the back of an empty chair. That shirt. Why the fuck was he wearing that ugly bag of a shirt? She’s never seen him dressed like that before. He’s actually sort of stylish for a straight man. If he weren’t such a lazy stoner, he’d totally fit the category of metrosexual. He might even be a queer in denial—it wouldn’t surprise Max; she’s seen plenty of “straight” men enjoying themselves at the club.  Whatever Jerome’s sexual preference, Max is sure of one thing: he is a liar. A no-good, dirty liar… A liar… A…</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Then he recognizes her. Fuck, Jerome thinks, Fuck, it’s that little queer from the apartment next door. His mother is sick, like, about-to-die sick. Maureen takes them food sometimes. He’s a good kid, works all the time, takes good care of his mother. He’s all she has. Oh, fuck, Jerome thinks again, reaching into the pocket of his jeans and fingering the pouch of drugs. This is it for Max.</p>  
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Beneath the pouch is a small hole in the fabric of his pocket. Jerome sticks his forefinger inside and feels a few of the stitches pop, widening the tear. Oh, God damn it. He knows what he needs to do. As he walks slowly toward the exit by the bathrooms, he sticks another finger through the hole and works open the seam. The stitches unravel quickly. He pushes the pouch through the hole and feels it slide down his leg. He shakes his foot and it’s gone. There goes his freedom.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Jerome swings open the exit at the end of the dark hall and walks into the yellow light of the alley. He hopes the door will lead to the alley where the cops’ van is parked, but emerging from the crowded club, he realizes his sense of direction is addled. This alley stretches the length of the block. He has to get all the way to the end before he reaches the bisecting alley where the cops’ van sits near 4 ½ Street. Fuck.</p> 
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">He walks quickly, listening for the clunk of the metal door sealing the club behind him. A bulb lighting the end of the alley flickers and dies. A cat on the fire escape above him lets out a wretched, high-pitched cry. Jerome shivers. In a minute, he’ll be safe, though he won’t yet be free. Jesus Christ, he doesn’t give a shit about freedom; right now he just wants to be safe. He walks faster. The alley elongates before him.</p> 
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">Why hasn’t he heard that goddamn door shut? He doesn’t look back. He listens. What he hears is the sound of heavy boots against the concrete, cold and fast, close and getting closer. He starts to run, but it’s too late. A huge hand grabs the collar of his shirt and yanks him backward. The tape tears at his skin and hair as the wire is ripped from his body and flung against the brick wall. He falls to the ground and faces the barrel.</p>
                    <p class="light-gray text-left pad-bottom">For an instant Jerome sees Sophia’s sleeping face.</p>
